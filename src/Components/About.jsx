      I'm a business student at Galatasaray University but my path crossed with programming thanks to Re:Coded Web Development Bootcamp. I think i found an important enthusiasm source by learning how to code. Besides the technologies i got familiar with so far (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.Js) i am interested in trying & exploring different technologies. There is no limit to learn !
      I am also actively working and creating projects in civil society field where i found the phenomenal power of collaboration and teamwork. One of my dreams is to implement technology for social good.
